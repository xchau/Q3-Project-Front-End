# this.city

Imagine this: you're walking to the grocery store to pick up some milk and you come across *that* alley. The one that's always littered with broken glass. What do you do? What can you do?

The purpose of this.city is to provide people like you with a means of alerting your community to potentially dangerous or unsightly areas in your city. This puts a spotlight on communal problems and generates civic interest in solving them. So have a gripe? Pin it and take your first step toward improving this.city.

## Features
Users of **this.city** can create and track observable issues around their city. The app allows users to detail information about a particular issue and pin it to a map where other users may view it. Other users may also verify (up vote) or contradict (down vote) the claims made by the original poster to generate more/less public interest. This creates a healthy citizen-driven ecosystem for the maintenance and betterment of one's community.
