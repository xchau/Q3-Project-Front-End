##Project Description
Whether you live in the big city or a small hamlet, there are always things to improve. **this.city** serves to provide locals with an outlet to express their concerns about their city and potentially crowd-source solutions to the problems at hand.  

##Features
Users of **this.city** can create and track observable issues around their city. The app allows users to detail information about a particular issue and pin it to a map where other users may view it. Other users may also verify (up vote) or contradict (down vote) the claims made by the original poster to generate more/less public interest. This creates a healthy citizen-driven ecosystem for the maintenance and betterment of one's community.

##Technologies Used
* React Native
* React Native Google Maps
* Android Studio (SDK managment)
* PostgresQL
* JavaScript
  * Axios
  * ExpressJS
  * Node.js
  * Knex.js

##Future Development
1. Allow for users to leave comments on issues

3. Allow for users to close issues via voting
4. Scale map markers with zoom-level
5. Scaling scenes for various devices & resolutions
6. Input validation
7. Proper authorization
