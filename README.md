# this.city

Imagine this: you're walking to the grocery store as per weekly routine and you pass by *that* alley. The one that's notorious in your neighborhood for always being littered with broken glass and loose garbage. What actions can you take to make this less of a routine? How can you warn others?

The purpose of this.city is to provide people like you with a means of alerting your community to potentially dangerous or unsightly areas in your city. This puts a spotlight on communal problems and generates civic interest in solving them. So have a gripe? Pin it and take your first step toward improving this.city.
